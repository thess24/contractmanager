################## TODO #################

# edit / delete of...
	# sites
	# teams
	# phys
	# physgroup
	# users
# filter people you can add based on system they are in
# make forms look good
# ability for admin to reset user password
# finish addtemplate html file- modal popup from ajax, copy data on load, render on pageup
# fix footer
# alerts should show warning color based on level of alert
# make admin display better
# make addon template on form submit work (currently just adds to base template)



# new contract page
	# - forms display properly
	# - added template tags actually display
	# - current input field tags actually display
# edit contract page
	# - send to group/user makes popup and submits form
	# - actual templates load on right
	# - edit contract area - one tab for html, one tab from html_output
	# - inputs all loaded at top of page
# manage workflows page
	# - groups actually loaded on right
	# - ability to upload unknown number of inputs and create workflow object
	# - Dragging box adds data to input


### BIG
# figure out how to save in db (EAV, jsonb, etc)
# messaging that form has submitted
# get alert system and contract log up and running
# page for a physician to show all contracts
# Work on contract flow and adding/passing contracts along pipeline
	# 1. get contract submit and passing to work w/o js stuff
	# 2. all js on contract create page done
	# 3. js and submitting on current contracts done


# PLAN
# finish new and edit contract pages
# finish workflow pages
# get database setup
# get analytics up and running





# look into task runner to drop and add database

#### DROP/ADD DB Instructions
# All in terminal
# 1. dropdb cmdb
# 2. createdb cmdb
# 3. python manage.py migrate auth
# 4. python manage.py migrate
# 5. python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com

#### DROP/ADD DB Instructions in Heroku
# 1. heroku pg:reset DATABASE_URL
# 2. heroku run python manage.py migrate auth
# 3. heroku run python manage.py migrate
# 4. 



########## DEPLOYMENT ISSUES

# make sure app can view env varianbles -- especially for superuser creation password
# make sure no errors on fresh install (related to pythonpath and wsgipath)
