                Baldur Healthcare was started by a healthcare professional working on a compliance project looking for software that fit all of the projects needs.   While a few solutions existed in the market, there were none that covered all of the projects needs while also being affordable, user friendly, and easy to use.  Baldur Healthcare was born out of this to provide a full package of healthcare compliance software that not only solved all of the compliance issues, but did so at a lower cost and with better results.
