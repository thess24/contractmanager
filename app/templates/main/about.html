            <div class="col-lg-12 aboutus-text wow fadeInRight">
                Baldur Healthcare was started by a healthcare professional working on a physician arrangements compliance project looking for software that fit all of the projects needs.   While a few solutions existed in the market, there were none that covered all of the projects needs while also being affordable, user friendly, and easy to use.  Baldur Health Care was born out of this to provide a full package of healthcare compliance software that not only solved all of the compliance issues, but did so at a much lower cost and with better results.
